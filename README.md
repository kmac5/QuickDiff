QuickDiff

A Qt wrapper around 'gvim -d' allowing the user to quickly drag files into the UI and launch a diff.

Features two convenience buttons:

* 'Swap Files' simply swaps the file order in the diff

* 'Toggle on top' allows the user to toggle the window's 'Stay on top' behavior when needed.  The default state is 'on'.
